Weather app utilizes https://openweathermap.org/api download the source and run as needed using Visual Studio 2017.

You will likely want to create your own api_id if you want to use this application for some serious useage...otherwise the provided api-id will allow you to do up to 60 request an hour which if exceeded you will be blocked from the system for a period. Enjoy!

The guts of Weather app are in the javascript requests which call out to the Openweathermap api which returns all the information needed to display in the body of the page.
